			<p class="hi"> <a href="http://cymande-online.com/"> Cymande (Sah-mahn-day) </a> are a British funk group that released several albums throughout the early 1970s. The group was formed in 1971 in London, England by musicians from Guyana, Jamaica and Saint Vincent. The name Cymande is derived from a Calypso word for Dove, which symbolizes peace and love.

				<p class="hi">The group developed a subtle and complex, deep funk style influenced by calypso rhythms, jazz, African music, American soul and UK rock of the time. By the mid-1970s the band members were going their separate ways, and the group disbanded in 1974. It was not until 20 years later that they reaped any financial rewards, as their music became a popular source for samplers. Cymande's original albums are still widely sought-after by DJs and funk aficionados. Perhaps the band's best known recording is the soulful dancefloor filler called Bra, which was later sampled by the American hip-hop group De La Soul and used as a breakbeat record by Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash.

				<p class="hi">Cymande was accidentally discovered by English producer John Schroeder in a Soho, London club where they were rehearsing. He was there to see a rock band but the gig had been cancelled, and he stumbled upon these West Indian musicians. He soon signed the band and recorded their initial single <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Cymande/The+Message+-+A+Cymande+Anthology+(disc+1)"> The Message </a> . The single was released by Janus Records, a division of Chess Records. The track reached #20 on the US Billboard R&B chart. This set the stage for Cymande's self-titled release in 1972.

				Cymande traveled to New York after the success of the first album, and began a tour of the US with Al Green. They also shared a few bills with the Latin funk ensemble Mandrill. They played a few important venues, including The Apollo, and played a gig on Soul Train.

				The band released three LPs for Janus. However, their final album, Promised Heights, was not released in the US, where Cymande had achieved their initial success. Promised Heights included "Brothers on the Slide", "The Recluse" and "Promised Heights". The tracks "Brothers on the Slide" and "Bra" also were staples of the rare groove scene which developed in London and New York nightclubs during the 1980s.

				Members of the band reunited for a performance in Brighton on 19 May 2006, during the UK Funk All-Stars night, as part of the Brighton Festival 2006.
